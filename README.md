<h1 align="center">ALX Low-Level Programming</h1>
This repository contains my solutions to the tasks that I completed while studying low level programming at Holberton School, mainly with the C language.

## Technologies Used

During a large majority of the timeline, I worked in my personal Ubuntu local environment (not the sandbox that was provided). Some of the tools I used include:

- [Oh-My-ZSH](https://ohmyz.sh/): A Unix shell, similar to Bash.
- [Valgrind](https://valgrind.org/): A programming tool for memory debugging, leak detection and profiling.
- [GCC](https://gcc.gnu.org/): Compiler for C/C++.
- [Make](https://www.gnu.org/software/make/manual/make.html): Utility tool that I use for running repetitive commands.
- [Betty](https://github.com/holbertonschool/Betty): Holberton-style C code checker written in Perl.
- [GDB](https://www.sourceware.org/gdb/): Command-line debugger that works with many low level languages including C/C++.
- [Neovim](https://neovim.io/): An upgraded version of the VIM code editor.
- [WSL](https://learn.microsoft.com/en-us/windows/wsl/install): Virtualization technology by Microsoft, that enables working with Linux in Windows.

## Usage

Each project and task contains the instructions to compile the code and execute the results.

## Inspiration

The format for the Readme files in this project was heavily inspired by [Santiago Arboleda](https://github.com/monoprosito), a former student of Holberton School Software Engineering.
